# RFM-Analysis-on-Sales-Data
SQL_RFM
In this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of customer purchasing behavior by analyzing a sales dataset. To achieve this, we will employ the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) technique for customer segmentation. Additionally, we will be working on various skills such as importing data into a SQL Server Database, utilizing SQL aggregate functions, window functions, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs).
